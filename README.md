# Tegelram
A [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for [Deno](https://deno.land/).  

## Introduction
The `Tegelram` bot will not have any particular features of its own, to start. 
It will simply be a direct map of the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).  

Once the basic functions all work, I will be adding more advanced features that most other telegram bots have.

## Examples
Examples show basic usage of the `Tegelram` bot.  

## Tegelram API
The `Tegelram` API will be as close a copy of the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). 
There will be no special features in the `vanilla` release.   
There will be documentation for the `Tegelram` API here, but it will only come with the completion of a basic version of the `vanilla` release.

### Roadmap
This is how I see the `Tegelram` bot and its feature set growing.  
The Roadmap might change at any point.
#### Vanilla
- [ ] Implement basic API
- [ ] Map all basic Types
- [ ] Implement advanced API (File upload+)
- [ ] Map advanced Types 
- [ ] Seperate Types into smaller files
- [ ] Seperate API into smaller modules
